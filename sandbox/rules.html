        <button class="collapsible">1. COMMON SENSE</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Don't do dumb shit that would go against conventional thinking. If it seems like its hurtful to others,
                the server, or just seems like a bad idea.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">2. PROP ABUSE</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Propkill, proppush, propblock, propclimb, propspam, etc., is not allowed.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">3. BASING</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>When making your base, make sure its possible to enter, with a keypad on both sides of the entrance door.
                Bases do not generally have any limits on doors or the amount of space they take up, but keep the
                ability for others to raid your base fun and possible, and don't have it negatively impact the
                experience of others. In addition, keeping your spawn in someone's base, or spawning in props/entities
                without permission is not allowed.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">4. WIREMOD/E2/STARFALL</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The use of Wiremod/E2/Starfall in a way that negatively affects the way others play is not allowed. If it
                seems unbalanced, unoptimized, or something you wouldn't fight against, don't use it.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">5. PAC3</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The use of an NSFW PAC (stuff considered 18+), or a playermodel smaller than the regular citizen
                playermodel is not allowed (this includes Outfitter).</p>
        </div>
        <button class="collapsible">6. CHEATING/EXPLOITING</button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Don't cheat, plain and simple. The use of anything that isn't intended to be used in-game that gives you
                an advantage (like cheats), including bugs & server/addon exploits, is not allowed.</p>
